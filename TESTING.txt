Testing


The test.sh script tests the server by sending identical concurrent requests and checking if the responses are all the same.


Additional testing for custom requests like malformed ones and back-to-back requests were made using telnet. Also made some curl requests to test .htaccess and 403 errors I forgot to copy down.
